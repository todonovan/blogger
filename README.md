# README

This project has been created as part of a Ruby on Rails tutorial, offered by Jumpstart Labs.

The introductory tutorial takes you step-by-step through building a simple blog app.

To follow along with the tutorial yourself, visit their site at: [tutorials.jumpstartlab.com](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com).

The project was recommended by [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com), an open source resource for learning web development.
